# discordIP
sends the IP of the bot to the channel specified in the config.json. reacts to every message to that channel!

I made this because i don't have a static IP at home, but i want to connect to my local VPN.

edit the config.json with [a bot token from discord](https://discord.com/developers/applications), and [a channel ID](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-).

The bot can't get himself in your server. for that, use this link: [https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENTIDFROMDISCORD&scope=bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENTIDFROMDISCORD&scope=bot).
